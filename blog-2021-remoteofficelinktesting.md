When ordering a new link from an Service Provider - I've found it a good practise to always
record and document various tests to help when you need to troubleshoot a problem that runs over
a particular line or understand from an accounting perspective what your paying for.

Recently I've been working on a project to uplift various remote branch sites. One of the key
deliverables is to both order and provision a new carrier link that then goes back into a larger
MPLS network. What I've found is that by using tools like iPerf to test throughput between sites
is a quick way of making sure your getting the right bandwidth for what your paying for. It's already
saved my bacon twice now by working with the Service Provider before launch to ensure the correct bandwidth
is provisioned so theres no nasty surprises come open-day.

Another great tool I've found to help with these metrics is using PRTG and its many sensors like 
SNMP/PING/JITTER to monitor the performance of a carrier's link and rapidly identify faults in real time. 
I really enjoy the fact that it records all these metrics for histoical purposes too - Helps a bunch when it comes
to understanding how long a problem as been lurking on a given link and what sort of usage over time a particular
link has had.
