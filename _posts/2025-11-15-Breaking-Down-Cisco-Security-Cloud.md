So picture this - I get home from Cisco Live 2025 and my 8 year old asks me "SO DADDY HOW WAS THE TRIP" to which I reply with "It was busy! but I had a lot of fun" but I caught myself say "and I learnt a lot about Security Cloud". Immediately my daughter without missing a beat replies with "what's that?". Here I am, 9pm sitting in the hallway of my house thinking of a way I could distill 10 hours of Technical Marketing material that's nailed into my head into something my 8 year old daughter can comprehend...

- Me: "Well it's basically a big bubble that follows you wherever you go. It's job is to keep you safe"
- Daughter: "Like from robbers?"
- Me: "Kinda! wait yes let's go with that. It's job is to keep you safe whether your on your iPad or on your computer. Whether your at home/school or at your grandma's house it follows you around"
- Daughter: "Cool! sounds cwazy"
- Me: "A little bit yes"

Now presuming your not my 8 year old, you probably want a bit more of a mature explanation of Cisco's Security Cloud. Well Security Cloud is Cisco's Platform Approach to their Security Products. I'll be the first one to admit that in previous years the Security Products have been confusing and often overlapping making your decision to what you buy that much harder. This makes it much more easier to navigate the Product Line now.

Going a bit deeper now - Security Cloud is comprised of 3 pillars otherwise known as Protection Suites outlined below:
-User Protection Suite
-Cloud Protection Suite
-Breach Protection Suite

Each one of these Suites represents a group of services that you can enable to keep all the different aspects of your Enterprise Secure. The below picture outlines all the different products each of these suites has to offer.

Security Cloud is there to bring all these products together in a common interface for users. The key word that I heard a lot over Cisco Live was "Common". This boils down to having all your security products in the same place and being able to define objects and controls across your enterprise. This is really cool when you think about being able to define something once and reuse it across your Firewalls/CASB/SWG/ZTA Policy and more!

I need to make a special call out with the UI. Cisco's Common (there's that word again) UI is really making things easier to navigate and not feel like a complete boofhead everytime you navigate between products.
